# Specma

_Simple and composable validation_

Specma is a Javascript library that allows validating any value against a predefined, reusable and composable spec.

> _Wait... what!? Another validation library? But why?_

- Validation based on **predicate functions** that return `true` or a custom reason
- Collection specs defined with the exact **same shape as the value**
- **Composable specs** with intuitive `and` and `or` operations
- **Async validation** with promises out of the box
- Easy **internationalization** of messages
- Built-in **spread (...)** validation
- Very **small footprint**
